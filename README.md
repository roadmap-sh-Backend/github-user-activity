This is my work from [Roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh) on [second task](https://roadmap.sh/projects/github-user-activity)  

# Technology
I'm just using Go as programming language.  

# How to run
Run this code using command `go run . github-activity <username> <github_event>`  

# Architecture
I just separate the codes by it's meaning like `types.go` for the structs declaration,  and `main.go` for logic and main executioner of this programs
